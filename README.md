# bing-annihilator
 Automatically redirect Bing search results to Google
 
 # Usage
 What is this extension good for? You might ask.
 Well, in Visual Studio 2019 whenever you use the "Search online" feature, it will automatically use Bing. I couldn't find a way to change it so this is the next best.
 
 Keep in mind this will only redirect to Google whenever a new tab is created, where the new url domain is bing.com and has a search query
 
 # Installation
 I don't have this extension hosted on the Chrome store for now.
 You'll have to manually install it yourself (Don't worry, there are no viruses. Trust me 😎)
 
 Steps:
  1. Download the project as ZIP
  2. Stare into your screen and wait for a 29KB file to download
  3. Once downloaded, extract the zip file to anywhere you would like
  4. Open Chrome (or any browser that supports Chrome extensions I suppose)
  5. You can either navigate to chrome://extensions/, or click ⋮ -> More tools -> Extensions (if you like to take the long way)
  6. Click "load unpacked"
  7. A explorer prompt should now open, navigate to the bing-annihilator folder. You need to make sure you select the folder where the manifest.json file is located at
  8. Click "Select folder"
  
  You're now done! Enjoy your Bing-free experience

  # Bug reports
  I've never made a bug, so this is a surprise. But if you do encounter one, or unwanted behaviour, make a new issue and I'll see what I can do.
